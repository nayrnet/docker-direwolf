# ðŸ“¡ direwolf
A multi-platform image for running [Direwolf] for APRS projects

## tags:
 - latest - built off dev branch (1.7.x)
 - stable - built off main branch (1.6.x)

## built with:
 - runs as non-root user
 - rtl-sdr
 - netcat
 - hamlib2
 - gpsd

## notes:
This is a slightly customized version that I use for https://igate.nayr.net, it can run as a standard standalone docker install but has been specifically crafted for:
 - netcat is included so you can pipe the output via IP, I use this for the web tail to a sidecar.
 - direwolf stats patch of my own creation to enable SBEACON support, this is a hack to dump internal stats to a file that can be scraped externally.
   - this is harmless, with below config it will dump stats out to /tmp/dw-stats.txt every 5m
     - SBEACON	sendto=IG delay=00:30 every=5
   - requires a metrics scraping sidecar, /tmp ramdisk and start script to copy /usr/local/bin/dw-* scripts to /tmp for sidecar.
I with further testing and development I intend to release both docker-compose and helm charts to easily and quickly deploy your own igate site like mine.
