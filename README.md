# ðŸ“¡ direwolf
A multi-platform image for running [Direwolf] for APRS projects

## tags:
 - latest - built off dev branch (1.7.x)
 - stable - built off main branch (1.6.x)

## built with:
 - runs as non-root user
 - rtl-sdr
 - netcat
 - hamlib2
 - gpsd

## notes:
This is a slightly customized version that I use for https://igate.nayr.net, it can run as a standard standalone docker install but has been specifically crafted for:
 - direwolf stats patch of my own creation to enable SBEACON support, this is a hack to dump internal stats to a file that can be scraped externally.
 - netcat is included so you can pipe the output via IP, I use this for the web tail.

## Installing
